# Project - Erkorektor

The aim of this study is to develop a mobile application that supports the process of shaping correct pronunciation. The application is intended not only to facilitate the work of speech therapists but also to enable patients to practice pronunciation independently at a convenient time and place. The main tasks of the application include speech recording, speech analysis, and providing exercises that will help users improve their pronunciation.

The study focuses on the sound "sz" due to its specific characteristics, which make it an ideal subject for analysis in the context of speech therapy. Consultation with a speech therapist revealed that "sz" is a sound that can be prolonged during pronunciation, allowing for more precise monitoring and analysis of articulation problems. The choice of this sound is also strategic: if an effective model for the "sz" sound can be developed, the application could be similarly expanded to include other sounds, significantly increasing its usefulness in speech therapy. As a result, the application could support a broader range of speech exercises covering diverse sounds and phonemes.
